Hands up don't shoot! Camera

This is intended to be a workshop on how to make a hands up don’t shoot glove. When the person wearing the glove puts up their hands in self defense, the motion triggers the camera, takes 10 photos, and posts them to Instagram. 

Currently this is an initial iteration designed by <a href="http://labofspeculativeethnology.tumblr.com/">The Laboratory of Speculative Ethnology</a>

1 Cable Camera Pi</br>
1 Pimoroni enviro phat</br>
1 LiPo battery</br>
1 Pimoroni Zero LiPo</br>
1 glove that you want to build it into</br>

1 Adafruit Micro Lipo w/MicroUSB Jack - USB (only if you don’t have something to charge the LiPo with)</br></br></br>
